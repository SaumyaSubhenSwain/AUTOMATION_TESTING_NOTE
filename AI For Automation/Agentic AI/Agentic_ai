What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can act autonomously to achieve a goal by making decisions, planning steps, and taking actions without constant human intervention.

Unlike normal Generative AI (which only responds to prompts), Agentic AI can:

Set sub-goals

Plan steps

Use tools (APIs, databases, browsers)

Make decisions based on feedback

Retry if something fails

🧠 Simple Difference
Generative AI	Agentic AI
Responds to prompt	Takes actions toward a goal
One-step output	Multi-step reasoning
No memory of tasks	Can maintain context & memory
Example: Write an email	Example: Plan and book a trip
🔎 Example to Explain in Interview

If you say:

“Book the cheapest flight from Delhi to Mumbai next week.”

Generative AI → Will suggest options.

Agentic AI →

Searches flights

Compares prices

Applies filters

Selects cheapest option

Books ticket

Sends confirmation

That decision-making + action-taking behavior = Agentic AI

🏗️ How Agentic AI Works

Agentic AI usually consists of:

1️⃣ LLM (Brain)
2️⃣ Memory (Short-term + Long-term)
3️⃣ Planner
4️⃣ Tool usage capability
5️⃣ Feedback loop

Example frameworks:

OpenAI

LangChain

Microsoft AutoGen

🔥 Real-World Examples

Autonomous customer support bots

AI DevOps assistant

Self-debugging coding agents

AI research assistants

Autonomous trading bots

💼 How You Connect It to QA (Very Important)

As a QA Automation Engineer, Agentic AI impacts:

1️⃣ Autonomous Test Agents

AI that:

Reads requirements

Generates test cases

Executes tests

Analyzes failures

Regenerates test steps

2️⃣ Self-Healing Frameworks

AI detects failure → updates locator → re-runs test automatically.

3️⃣ Intelligent Bug Triage

AI agent:

Reads logs

Classifies bug severity

Assigns to correct team

🎯 Strong Interview Answer (Speak Like This)

“Agentic AI is an advanced AI system that not only generates responses but can autonomously plan, reason, and take actions to achieve a specific goal. It uses LLMs along with memory, planning modules, and tool integration. In testing, Agentic AI can be used to build autonomous test agents that generate, execute, and analyze test cases with minimal human intervention.”
